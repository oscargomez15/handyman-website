Built a Handyman Website for GIAL Handyman and Cleaning Business from Cape Coral, FL

Used React, CSS, EmailJS and FontAwesome as the main technologies behind it to create the logic, visuals and interactivity.

The business's online presence was enhanced by using appropriate SEO tools allowing for an increment of leads from 3 monthly leads to 8 leads.

EmailJS was used to reduce the cost of paying a third-party paid subscription as their reach is limited and the free-tier quota was more than enough.

Canva was used for the creation of the Business Logo.

Google Reviews widget was implemented to add credibility to the website and increase the change of getting high quality leads locally.
